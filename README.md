# TDSRandomizer
A randomization script for Tower Defense Simulator.

**Note:** You need Python 3 installed on your computer to use this script. I'd also recommend using Command Prompt (Windows) or the Terminal (Mac) to run it (simply use `python3 TDSRandomizer.py`).

**Installing termcolor**

TDSRandomizer uses the `termcolor` Python module to display eye-appealing bolded text. You can install it using one of the following methods:

On Windows, macOS, etc.: `python3 -m pip install termcolor`

For Linux, it is also distribution dependent. Distributions may package it as `python3-termcolor`,`python-termcolor`, etc. You can also install it via PIP.
