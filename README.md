# TDSRandomizer
A randomization script for Tower Defense Simulator.

**Note:** You need Python 3 installed on your computer to use this script. I'd also recommend using Command Prompt (Windows) or the Terminal (Mac) to run it (simply use `python3 TDSRandomizer.py`).

If you don't have Git installed to clone this repository you can download the script in Releases.
